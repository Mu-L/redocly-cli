## API design principles

A list of workflows that should be completed before current workflow can be processed.
To avoid ambiguity or potential clashes, the `dependsOn` list values should be unique.

## Configuration

| Option   | Type   | Description                                             |
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| severity | string | Possible values: `off`, `warn`, `error`. Default `off`. |

An example configuration:

```yaml
arazzoRules:
  workflow-dependsOn: error
```

## Examples

Given the following configuration:

```yaml
arazzoRules:
  workflow-dependsOn: error
```

Example of an **incorrect** `dependsOn` list:

```yaml Incorrect example
workflows:
    - workflowId: get-museum-hours
      description: This workflow demonstrates how to get the museum opening hours and buy tickets.
      dependsOn:
        - get-museum-hours-2
        - get-museum-hours-3
        - get-museum-hours-2
```

Example of a **correct** `dependsOn` list:

```yaml Correct example
workflows:
    - workflowId: get-museum-hours
      description: This workflow demonstrates how to get the museum opening hours and buy tickets.
      dependsOn:
        - get-museum-hours-2
        - get-museum-hours-3
```
